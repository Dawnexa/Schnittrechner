## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds and are grateful for the time you spend to enhance our project. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please first check our [issue list](https://github.com/Dawnexa/Schnittrechner/issues) to see if someone else has already reported it. If not, you can create a new issue, providing as many details as possible about the bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing feature, we would love to hear about it. Please create a new issue and describe your idea there. Provide as many details as possible to help us understand and implement your idea.

### Submitting Pull Requests

If you want to contribute code yourself, you can do this by submitting a pull request (PR). Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes in this branch.
3. Submit a PR and describe your changes in the PR form.

Please note that your PR may not be accepted immediately. We may ask you to make some changes before we can accept your PR. We appreciate your patience and your willingness to work with us to improve the project.
